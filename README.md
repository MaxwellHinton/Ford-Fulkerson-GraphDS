# Ford-Fulkerson-GraphDS
Implementing Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm in Python, using a graph data structure.

The aim of this project is to implement the Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm to compute maximum flow
within a flow network. 

Initially, networks will be hard-coded, so that the relevant algorithms can be implemented
in the early stages. After hard-coded networks pass, randomly generated networks will be 
implemented.

Finally, a GUI representation will be created to show the Ford-Fulkerson process in action.
